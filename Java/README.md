A series of concese examples of the basics on the Java language.

# How to run the examples

Make sure Java is installed on your machine.
All examples are built and tested using Java 11 on Debian Bookworm. You can grab it for your operative system from the link or command below.
Windows: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11
Linux:
    Debian/Ubuntu/Kali: `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`
    Arch/Manjaro: `sudo pacman -S jdk11-openjdk`
    Fedora/RedHat: `sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel.x86_64`

To run the example, open your command prompt or terminal emulator:
On Windows, press Shift + RightClick and select "Open Command Prompt here" (Windows Vista to 8.1), "Open Powershell here" (Windows 10) or "Open Windows Terminal here" (Windows 11).
On all Linux distros it will change based on your enviroment. In the case of Ubuntu Gnome, right click the folder and select "Open in Terminal".

With your command interpreter open, type `./gradle.bat run` for Windows and `./gradle run` for Linux.
