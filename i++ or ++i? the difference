in a for iteration, writing i++ makes the compiler retreive the value first, then incrementing it

writing ++i, the compiler doens't care of the actual value and increases it directly, it discards the value.

It's good for a more optimized approach if you don't need the value you're incrementing for a comparison, or anything else.
