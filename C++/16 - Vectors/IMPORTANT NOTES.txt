std::vector it's not only for integers, but it's a type that accepts other types as well:

std::vector<char> a; means that for each char pushed back in the vector there will be automatically a position for it, behaving like 
std::string or char[] or char *.

std::vector<char*> will act like char *strings[]; where for each position you can receive a undefined number of chars.

this beavior is similar to std::array.

Also can be replicated with integers/doubles ecc:

std::vector<int*> integers;
