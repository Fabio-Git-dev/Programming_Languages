What happens here is: 
1) the first cicle starts
2) Multiplies XY[i] = 1 * XY[i+1] = 2
3) i increases to 1, and it referres to the previous i+1 element, which was 2.
4) 2 is being reused to be multiplied with it's next coordinate, which is 3
5) We get wrong results, until we reach a i+1 out of bounds position. */
