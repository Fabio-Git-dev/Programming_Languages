/**
 * @file myHeader.h
 * @author Fabxx
 * @brief In This file we will put our prototypes of data and functions to include in source files.
 * 
 *         NOTES:
 * 
 *              -The standard extension for header files is .h
 *              
 *              -If a header file is associated with a source file, it's good practice
 *               that both header and source file have the same name.
 *              
 *               -Do not include std libraries in header files unless you have to develop 
 *               source code in there.
 * @version 0.1
