 * @brief This program shows how we can operate on class variable with a constant function.
 * 		  a constant function shouldn't be able to edit a variable because, like the name 
 * 		  suggests, a value operated by a constant function can't be changed. To be 
 * 		  able to do so, we create a mutable variable to pass to the constant function, so the
 *       constant function used to access the class can still edit it's objects. We're trying
 * 		to edit an integer with a constant access to the class.
