/**
 * @file main.cpp
 * @author your name (you@domain.com)
 * @brief similar to the previous one, but in this case multiple pointers can access to the 
 *        same object at any time since it's shared memory, keeping a reference counter
 *        that traces the pointers to the object.
 * 
 *      FUNCTIONS:
 *              -use_count() prints the number of times the pointer has been used.
 *              -unique: makes the pointer a unique_ptr type, which makes his object 
 *              not sharable (see 44.1)
 *              -owner_before: checks if the pointer precedes other in implementation defined owner-based (as opposed to value-based) order.
 *                             in short words, if the pointer has the same ownership as the other pointers, but it was applied to it
 *                             before the other pointers or not.
