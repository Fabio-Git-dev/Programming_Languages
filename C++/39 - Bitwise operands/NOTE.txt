It is important to notice that the binary lenghts of the numbers depends on the architecture we are compiling for,
and the types we are using.

If we use normal "int" by default it's 64bits, which is represented with 8 numbers of 4 bytes:

1 = 00000001 where 8 x 4 = 64.

The bitwise operators can also be used in assignation context:

a ^= 10 equivalent of: a = a ^ 10;


THESE OPERANDS WORK IN C TOO.
