 * @brief Showing functions of static_cast<>(), const_cast, and more.
 * 
 * 	static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, 
 * 	with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. 
 * This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, 
 * and thus a check would be unnecessary. NOTE: casting to char takes ASCII table as reference: https://www.asciitable.com/
 * 		  
    dynamic_cast only works for pointers or references to polymorphic class types;
    const_cast can't change types, only const or volatile qualifiers;
    reinterpret_cast is for special circumstances, converting between pointers or references and completely unrelated types. 
	Specifically, it won't do numeric conversions.
    C-style and function-style casts do whatever combination of static_cast, const_cast and reinterpret_cast is needed to get the job done.
