In order for the compiler to recognize all the declarations, the header files must be put in the same order when those are referenced.

Also note to put always the standard libraries before any custom library made by you.

example:

main(){
  setup4();
  setup3(setup2);
  
  order:

#include <lib1.h>

void setup4();

#include <lib2.h>
void setup3();

#include <lib3.h>
void setup2();
