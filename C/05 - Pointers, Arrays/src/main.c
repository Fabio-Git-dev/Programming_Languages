/* 
    A pointer represents a memory address, which then contains a value.

    Pointers can only be initialized with other pointers (can also assign a pointer value by dereferencing a normal variable with the 
    dereference operator &), or with memory using malloc functions

    Pointers allow to pass values by reference instead of copying the actual value in memory.

    When passing by reference, we are saying pass the memory address of x to y, which then contains 10.

    if we call changeVar(y) without the &, we are copying y into x.

    Pointer initialization requires the * symbol before the var name.

    Remember that variable identifiers will be actual memory locations for the CPU.

    In the struct chapter we will cover struct pointers.

    Array indexes start from 1 when typing them in code, but memory indexing starts from 0,
    so if you need to insert 3 numbers in a array of ints for example, you need to give to it
    size of 4, then in loop it will go from 0 to 3.

      However in this case, it will print only the last two digits of the value. 
      Since the char type by default is 1 byte it will only consider the last byte of the number.

      So the pointer data type determines how many bytes to elaborate on a pointer, based on its size.

      We can use a for loop and scroll through the pointer to obtain the rest of the data byte per byte.

      With types that match the lenght this is not needed.

      NOTE: Data type visibility may vary based on the compiler, it is important for portability
            to use standard types with common sizes.
