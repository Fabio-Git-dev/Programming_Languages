char *string is the equivalent of char string[].

a doulbe pointer can also be declared and then defined like this:

extern char **strings;
or
extern char *strings[];

in this case, the pointer points to the position 1, allowing multiple character store without a specific size.

char *string[1] = {"any data initialized"};

Both act as pointers, where one has to be initialized and allocated, the other has a static
or a dynamic allocation based on which variable we use as a size inside the square parenthesis.

For a more simpler example about pointers, please check the "Pass by ref vs by value chapter"

NOTE: If you have to change the value of a pointer variable, don't rewrite it with the * symbol, just 
type the var name and =. Using the * symbol again means that you are reinitializing the pointer to something else.
