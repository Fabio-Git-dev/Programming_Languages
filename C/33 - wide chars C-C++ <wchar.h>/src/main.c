/*NOTE: Despite the fact that the type can handle strings and const chars, it's defined as short int.

char is 1 byte and follows ASCII lenght standard (does not allow characters that take more than one byte) 

in C/C++, we have also wchar_t (w stands for wide) that is defined as long char, allows special characters that take more than 1 byte.

(UNICODE format, like UTF16)

similar exmaples are char_16t, 32t, and so on, but they still follow ASCII standard %u for char16_t %U for char32_t.

to copy these type of strings instead of strcpy, you have to use wcscpy, from the library <wchar.h>.

wcstombs is used to convert a wchar_t to a const char *.
wcscat it's used to concatenate two widechar strings.

NOTE: Almost all the C string.h functions have these wide char equivalent functions

C library is <wchar.h>

C++ library is <cwchar> (same library but called in legacy way for C code.)
